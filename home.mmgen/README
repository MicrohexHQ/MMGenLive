MMGenLive

   MMGenLive is a fully functional Linux system with the MMGen online/offline
   Bitcoin wallet and related programs preinstalled. The latest MMGenLive
   bootable image can be found at the MMGenLive project page

  MMGenLive gives you, out of the box:

     * A minimal but fully upgradeable and configurable Ubuntu Linux system
       on a USB stick (the system currently occupies 1.2GB of disk space)
     * Full disk encryption, read/write filesystem
     * Bitcoin Core, and the MMGen wallet system preinstalled
     * Administrative scripts to make setup and configuration easy

   MMGenLive can be used both as an offline signing wallet and as an online
   tracking/transacting wallet with a full or pruned blockchain.

  Quick Start

    1. Practice switching back and forth between terminal tabs using
       Ctrl-PGDOWN. You’ll use this tab for viewing documentation and the
       other one for typing commands.
    2. In the other tab, type ‘mmlive-node-start -o’ to start bitcoind in
       offline mode. Note that the TAB key will conveniently complete
       partially-typed commands for you.
    3. Exit this pager with ‘q’ and type ‘less
       doc/Getting-Started-with-MMGen’. Follow the step-by-step instructions
       in the primer.
